<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, and sugar.</p>
</p>It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. 
    But it's well worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to this day. </p>
    <h2>Mojito ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup ice cubes,or as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ fluid ounces white rum</li>
        <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps for making the cocktail</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
        <li>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
        <li>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>
